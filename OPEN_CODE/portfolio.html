     <p>I love exploring new things.I have basic programming knowledge of C and Python.</p>
     <p>But I had learnt basic HTML during my school days. So accordingly I am currently learning HTML along with CSS so that I can progress more in the field of web development.</p>
     <p>I am also learning the basics of git and github.</p>
